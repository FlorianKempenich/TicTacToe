# Clean TicTacToe

The main goal of this app is not to make yet another TicTacToe android app. But it's much more deeper . . .
I mean literally. You'll have to dig deep to see why this app is different.

**The magic happens in the code**

## Why ?
I will completely drive this app using **Test Driven Developement** and the principles of **Code Craftmanship.**

That is readable code, Hexagonal architecture, tests that cover code but do not block refactoring. 
Basically it will be a showcase project of all the best practices I know and the ones I will learn along the way.

## The real goal
The real goal here is not to contemplate how great my code is . . . . it's not!

But I try my best, and that's all that is about : **Learning**

The last few month I studied the teachings of the Masters in Code Craftmanship : Kent Beck, Robert C. Martin, Martin Fowler and others.
After applying my learning to small projects and textbook cases. This is my first attempt at a *realtively* large project.

I guess we'll have to see how the project evolves ;)

###Future evolutions
* Finish implementing the game mechanic
* Add basic Android UI
* Turn it to elegant Material design
* Implement a server and enable online multiplayer (long term)
